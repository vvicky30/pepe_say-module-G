This is just 'initializing file' or we can say dummy-file ...
that i have to made for initializing folder with 'pepe_say_proj' name which is 
also the name of project direcotory where we save 'pyproject.toml' file , [initialized python virtual environment by name 'pepeenv'; which we're not going to upload here for obvious reasons].
it also contains module file with name 'pepe_say' where we saved 'pepesay_module.py' and '__main__.py' files which are source code files of module.
its alos contains 'dist' file which is generated automatically once we run command 'poetry build' in respective project directory.
  this 'dist 'file contains executable python-wheel file corrrsponds to pepe_say package and pepe_say.tar file which contains package information in details.
  
its also contains 'poetry.lock' file generated automatically once we run command 'poetry lock'
 this 'poetry.lock' files used to  serves as a record of all the exact versions of the dependencies used in a project during installation, 
  removal, or updating of any dependency. It ensures that your project uses the correct versions of dependencies by listing all the packages, 
   their exact versions, and the hashes of their source files (that in our case mentioned in 'pyproject.toml' file.)
